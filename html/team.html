                    In the year 2009, a group of environment enthusiasts established a platform called MIDAS

                    TOUCH with a vision to conserve the biodiversity and instill the slogan – better earth better

                    living to each and every soul living on this Planet.

                    Our commitment is strong and we are dedicated to the objectives that we have created looking

                    into account the deteriorating conditions and the need to conserve our biodiversity. Since its

                    inception, we have been actively engaged in spreading mass awareness about the need to plant

                    more trees, recycle things and also help the grassroots level to understand the nuances of climate

                    changes and its impact on humans and other living beings as well as understand why it is

                    necessary to turn our farming system to organic. Its commitment and work for the welfare of

                    people at large has placed it amongst the leading non-government organizations at the district

                    level of Manipur.

                    The philanthropic inclination of the activists came into existence with the initiation of people’s

                    involvement in different interventions for all-round development of the society. MIDAS TOUCH

                    is well equipped with qualified and motivated personnel with specialised experiences and also

                    rich expertise in development and research sector.

                    The prime focus of the organization at present is to provide mass awareness through seminars,

                    workshops, lectures about environmental issues, how each individual plays an important role.

                    Secondly we are extremely sensitive about conserving our indigenous medicinal and aromatic

                    plants and last but not the least employment generation of youth through promotion of

                    sustainable livelihood is one of the most critical objective of our organization. Moreover, the

                    organization is also looking forward to initiate a voluntary movement in which volunteers would

                    be largely encouraged and motivated to take up all the environmental activities with full

                    dedication, in days to come.
