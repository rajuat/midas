        Midas Touch is a nongovernmental organization founded in 2009 based at Imphal. It mainly focusses on

        Biodiversity conservation and we firmly believe in greener earth and better living. It aims to create a

        sustainable livelihood through community participation while simultaneously conserving the biodiversity.

        Employment generation of the youth and sustainable living are the foremost goal of our organization.

        The biodiversity of Manipur comprises endemic floral diversity, particularly medicinal plants of

        importance to pharmaceutical industry, and unique faunal diversity. Nevertheless, it is very unfortunate

        that this great land of biodiversity is least explored probably due to geographical and political constraints.

        Different anthropogenic and socio-economic factors have perturbed the pristine ecology of this region,

        leading to environmental degradation. With urbanization and development taking place at a speed of light

        in today’s world we are left at the mercy of technology which along with its benefits comes with a

        package of health hazards, environmental hazards and then ultimately leading to global warming. The

        continued growths of human populations and of per capita consumption have resulted in unsustainable

        exploitation of Earth’s biological diversity, exacerbated by climate change, ocean acidification, and other

        anthropogenic environmental impacts. We argue that effective conservation of biodiversity is essential for

        human survival and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Despite some conservation successes

        (especially at local scales) and increasing public and government interest in living sustainably,

        biodiversity continues to decline. Successful conservation approaches need to be reinforced and

        adequately financed. In addition, however, more radical changes are required that recognize biodiversity

        as a global public good, that integrate biodiversity conservation into policies and decision frameworks for

        resource production and consumption, and that focus on wider institutional and societal changes to enable

        more effective implementation of policy.
