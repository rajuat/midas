                        In the year 2009, a group of environment enthusiasts established a platform called MIDAS

                        TOUCH with a vision to conserve the biodiversity and instill the slogan â€“ better earth better

                        living to each and every soul living on this Planet.

                        Our commitment is strong and we are dedicated to the objectives that we have created looking

                        into account the deteriorating conditions and the need to conserve our biodiversity. Since its

                        inception, we have been actively engaged in spreading mass awareness about the need to plant

                        more trees, recycle things and also help the grassroots level to understand the nuances of climate

                        changes and its impact on humans and other living beings as well as understand why it is

                        necessary to turn our farming system to organic. Its commitment and work for the welfare of

                        people at large has placed it amongst the leading non-government organizations at the district

                        level of Manipur.
